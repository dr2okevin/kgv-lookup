# KGV (P/E) Lookup
A simple python script to grep the P/E from shares. It uses the yahoo finance api to collect the data.

I reccoment running it as cron task once per day.

The code was originally generated by chatGPT and I fixed afterwards some bugs.

you can configure your shares in the isin.json
Example:
```json
{
    "shares": [
        {
            "isin": "US0231351067",
            "ticker": "AMZN",
            "name": "Amazon"
        },
        {
            "isin": "US1912161007",
            "ticker": "KO",
            "name": "COCA-COLA CO. DL-,25"
        },
        {
            "isin": "US5801351017",
            "ticker": "MDO.DE",
            "name": "McDonald's Corporation"
        }
    ]
}
```
